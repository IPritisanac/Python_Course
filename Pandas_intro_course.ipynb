    "# The best practice is to import all the libraries your code needs at the beginning of the script.\n",
    "# Most of the libraries have some abbreviation which makes it easier and faster to use it in the code. For example, we can import pandas in two ways:\n",
    "import pandas   #or:\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "# In the first case, each time we want to use some of the built in functions of pandas, we need to write padnas.DataFrame, pandas.merge(), pandas.melt() etc.\n",
